Revision history for Perl extension TAP::Formatter::GitHubActions.

0.3.1  Mon 04 Dec 2023 17:58:41
	- New release ðŸŽ‰ packed with tests & a nifty feature!

	- Workflow summaries!

	Due to a limitation on GitHub there can only be 10 annotations displayed
	in any given workflow run. No matter how many error annotations your
	run raises, only the first 10 will be visible.

	Nevertheless, there's a Workflow Summary provided that doesn't suffer
	from this limitation. It'll be always linked as a notice at the
	beginning of every file containing a failing error.

	- Refactored much of the logic to use aggregation based on TAP test number,
	  it greatly simplified the code and made it much more testable.

	-- Happy prove-ing with GitHub Actions!

0.3.0_8  Mon 04 Dec 2023 17:58:41
